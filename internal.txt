
Proto:
- xx Add 100floor mode to lobby
- xx Generate each floor with code
- ww Custom music on a floor
	- xx can't do full custom with music = {type="Mod_song"},
		- "Failed to open streaming audio file 'ext/music/SomeMod_someSong.ogg'"
		- doens't even search mod directory
		- it does work if I manyually copy the music to the game's music folder...not a thing a mod can or shoudl do, though.
	- xx Custom playlists would be...cumbersome...and I may have to know the actual mod path on the filesystem. ewww.
- xx Test custom mixed run (vanilla and modded levels)

- MVP
	- A few prebuilt dungeons
	- full set of levels/bosses for the run



Ideas:

- Dungeon crawler mode: The Depths
	- Premise
		- Start on floor 1, try to get to 100.
		- Boss floors every 5 or 10, or randomly. But harder bosses.
		- Difficulty ramps up with depth.
	- Party dynamics idea:
		- If a player dies, you must pay to revive them.
		- If a player has much more item value than another (excluding start items), they must give to other players until value is more equal.
		- Can pay to revive players while still in a level.
		- Can't afford a revive anyway? Game over.
		- Swap with uncontrolled chars by bumping into them
		- Shared currency diamonds, private currency coins.
		- Revives cost diamonds, can sell stuff for diamonds if you can afford a revive.
		- Must unlock all chars on a level before continuing (if you trapdoor, they show up later mostly dead)
		- Revive and heal spells
	- Balance (long run equippment overrun)
		- Various obstacles that require you to decide what to keep and what to leave behind.
	- Maybe pull a bunch of enemy and items in as mod dependencies. (At least support thir enemy replacement if loaded.)
	- More music

	- Room types:
		- Cave-in: vanilla level collapses over time, killing any player buried
		- Rest/hot springs: refill HP, maybe a small shop with health items
		- Player balance: players can't continue until equipment value is roughly the same value, provide unequip traps
		- Boss: vanilla, or vanilla with extras
		- Enemy waves: walls hold back a massive horde of enemies and walls slowly disappear over time
			- Must kill all to unlock stairs
		- Coffin rush: many spawner coffins, destroy all coffins to unlock stairs
		- Vanilla level: plain or maybe with some level gen tweaks
		- Item gates: players must choose equipped item slots to "sell"/sacrifice to open the doors
			- Scale with players, and may be good to follow with an equippment balance shortly
		- Trap dungeon: mostly traps/fireballs/etc.; you have to maneuver through; only minor enemies)
		- Character swap: Each player must pick pick 1 of 3-4 random (including modded) characters to continue the run
		- Thief rush: So. Much. Stealing.
			- Rare.
		- Dragons and monkeys: Because what's more fun than a room full of dragons and monkeys?
		- Prefab: random level from a curated list
		- Other ideas: open lit field, tomb of traps, lava land, mazes, confusion or shock energy waves


	- Misc ideas:
		- Maybe have to switch to another character for a few levels and then rejoin group
		- Character leveling/rpg elements?
		- Can diamond buy a shortcut down to next floor, or several down
		- Probably all levels collapse in time...or the dungeon is sinking or something

	- Look into making it a custom mode shrine instead?

Modding API notes:
	- Level.Data's tile numbers: 0 = void, 1 = first item in tileNames
	- Level.Data's bounds is x/y/w/h, not x1/y1/x2/y2
	- CustomMusic.edit opens the edit GUI
	- CustomMusic.readMetadata: {
		author = "exampleuser",
		displayName = "Mod test playlist",
		songFileNames = { "C:\\blahblahblah\\music\\song1.ogg" }
	}

	- Custom modes: extraMode.Type.extend
	- To include file: have the included return something, then require "ModPrefix.filenamebase"
	- Probably should restart the game anytime you change mod.json, doens't seem to live reload
