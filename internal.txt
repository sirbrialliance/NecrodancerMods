Dungeon Modes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proto:
- xx Add 100floor mode to lobby
- xx Generate each floor with code
- ww Custom music on a floor
	- xx can't do full custom with music = {type="Mod_song"},
		- "Failed to open streaming audio file 'ext/music/SomeMod_someSong.ogg'"
		- doens't even search mod directory
		- it does work if I manually copy the music to the game's music folder...not a thing a mod can or should do, though.
	- xx Custom playlists would be...cumbersome...and I may have to know the actual mod path on the filesystem. ewww.
- xx Test custom mixed run (vanilla and modded levels)

- xx Can you go back to an earlier level?
	- xx LevelTransition.switchToLevel doesn't seem to exist (anymore?)
	- xx StateControl.seekRelative(-1) doesn't appear to do anything?
	- StateControl.changeLevel
		- Appears I can go back if I hand it a 1-based level index for a level I've been to.
		- Does nothing or hangs if I hand it a level that doens't exist or I haven't been to yet
		- If I go back, I get a similar level, with different details (same walls, differnt items and such)
			- Farm free store items with non-money chars...
	- LevelSequence.generate/update?
- xx Let you swap characters
	- xx add a trapSelectCharacter to some stairs?




- MVP
	- A few prebuilt dungeons
	- full set of levels/bosses for the run


Plans (the depths):
	- xx debug invincible
	- namespace change? (DDM)
	- Pull levels from random pool
		- Vanilla, to start
		- Then tweak results to be harder as you go deeper
	- Add waves room
	- Get on with it
		- music gets faster when things are boring:
			- anyone dead/descending for longer than a minute
			- 50%+ players dead/descending
	- Add death payment room
		- Payment rooms are safe+no beat
			- do that by fiddling with components on all the players?
		- track all player deaths
		- charge them for it
		- Go back option
	- Add equippment payment room
		- Go back option
	- Add curse room
		- Players must take on one of the offerend curses to continue
		- curses are "player rules", like taking damage on a missed beat
			- rhythmSkipEveryNth
			- extraModePhasingInnateItem
			- grooveChainInflictDamageOnDrop
	- Add balance room
		- player equippment cost must be roughly equal to continue, unequip provided


Ideas:

- Dungeon crawler mode: The Depths
	- Premise
		- Start on floor 1, try to get to 100.
		- Boss floors every 5 or 10, or randomly. But harder bosses.
		- Difficulty ramps up with depth.
	- Party dynamics idea:
		- If a player dies, you must pay to revive them.
		- If a player has much more item value than another (excluding start items), they must give to other players until value is more equal.
		- Can pay to revive players while still in a level.
		- Can't afford a revive anyway? Game over.
		- Swap with uncontrolled chars by bumping into them
		- Shared currency diamonds, private currency coins.
		- Revives cost diamonds, can sell stuff for diamonds if you can afford a revive.
		- Must unlock all chars on a level before continuing (if you trapdoor, they show up later mostly dead)
		- Revive and heal spells
	- Balance (long run equippment overrun)
		- Various obstacles that require you to decide what to keep and what to leave behind.
	- Maybe pull a bunch of enemy and items in as mod dependencies. (At least support thir enemy replacement if loaded.)
	- More music

	- Room types:
		- (We do have Random.noise2)
		- Cave-in: vanilla level collapses over time, killing any player buried
		- Rest/hot springs: refill HP, maybe a small shop with health items
		- Player balance: players can't continue until equipment value is roughly the same value, provide unequip traps
		- Boss: vanilla, or vanilla with extras
		- Enemy waves: walls hold back a massive horde of enemies and walls slowly disappear over time
			- Must kill all to unlock stairs
		- Coffin rush: many spawner coffins, destroy all coffins to unlock stairs
		- Vanilla level: plain or maybe with some level gen tweaks
		- Item gates: players must choose equipped item slots to "sell"/sacrifice to open the doors
			- Scale with players, and may be good to follow with an equippment balance shortly
		- Trap dungeon: mostly traps/fireballs/etc.; you have to maneuver through; only minor enemies)
		- Character swap: Each player must pick pick 1 of 3-4 random (including modded) characters to continue the run
		- Thief rush: So. Much. Stealing.
			- Rare.
		- Dragons and monkeys: Because what's more fun than a room full of dragons and monkeys?
		- Prefab: random level from a curated list
		- Other ideas: open lit field, tomb of traps, lava land, mazes, confusion or shock energy waves


	- Misc ideas:
		- Maybe have to switch to another character for a few levels and then rejoin group
		- Character leveling/rpg elements?
		- Can diamond buy a shortcut down to next floor, or several down
		- Probably all levels collapse in time...or the dungeon is sinking or something

	- Look into making it a custom mode shrine instead?

Modding API notes:
	- Level.Data's tile numbers: 0 = void, 1 = first item in tileNames
	- Level.Data's bounds is x/y/w/h, not x1/y1/x2/y2
	- CustomMusic.edit opens the edit GUI
	- CustomMusic.readMetadata: {
		author = "exampleuser",
		displayName = "Mod test playlist",
		songFileNames = { "C:\\blahblahblah\\music\\song1.ogg" }
	}

	- Custom modes: extraMode.Type.extend
	- To include file: have the included return something, then require "ModPrefix.filenamebase"
	- Probably should restart the game anytime you change mod.json, doens't seem to live reload
	- Okay, so fooComponent = false actually means "I specifically don't have this component.", not "I have this and there are no parameters,"
	- rhythm.getEffectiveSpeed(playerID)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Team Status
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Things:


- Notes:
	- Events:
		- objectUnspectate when local player joins (entity, playerID)
		- objectSpectate when local player leaves (entity, playerID)
		- objectDeath (entity, killer)
		- Generally: objectDeath or objectDelete preceeds objectDespawn, but players don't despawn when they die
		- objectDescentEnd (..., entity)
	- Player dead? player.killable.dead
		- ...but also spectator.active?
		- gameObject.active?
	- In stairs?
		- descent.active
		- descentDamageImmunity.active
		- targetable.active and position is stairs?
	- List resources:
		- I guess "ext/{path}" corrosponds to "{installDir}/data/{path}"
		- print("dirs", FileIO.listFiles("", FileIO.List.RECURSIVE, FileIO.List.DIRECTORIES))
		- print("files", FileIO.listFiles("ext/gui", FileIO.List.RECURSIVE, FileIO.List.FILES))
